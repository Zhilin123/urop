<!-- NOTES ON LEARNING -->
-!! Put all html files in folder: templates.
-!! Put all images file in static
- Block level and Inline level elements:
   -> Block level: start a new line and take full width eg. <div>, <h1>-<h6>, <p>, <form> which start a new block everytime
   -> Inline level: do not start on a new line, and take only the necessary width eg. <span>, <imag> which doesnt start a new Block
- Use tags to indicate which part is which part
- semantic tag: inline, can change in html and/or css. Eg, <strong> or <em> which are semantic tags in html BUT can modify the defalt meaning in css
- <a> tag: add an attribute, eg. a link to another page with attribute "href"
- open up a new tab: add after the href: target = "_blank"
- all tags can have attributes which provide information about an elemnet placed within the tag. Can use id.

-tags:
  -> <br> break from the previous Block
  -> <hr> horizontal line separating things from above block
  -> <div> block element that starts from another Inline
  -> <input> the input area
      -! input can have different type attribute to check the format of the input
      -! placeholder: for prompt
      -! type = submit: meaning the type is a submit button
  -> <textarea>: free text textarea
  -> <select>: dropdown menu
  -> <option>: the options under dropdown menus
  -> <img src = "path/asd.jpg" alt="My Sample Image">
- HTML file is a webpage file which can be clicked and run straight away. HOWEVER, it's just a static file that does not connect to the server
- HTML semantic tags:
  -> <header>
  -> <footer>
  -> <aside>
  -> <main>
  -> <article>
  -> <nav>
  -> <section>
  -> <details>
- Give id to the sections/headers/blahblah coz there may be more than one section
- id: unique for every section (use # for css identification)
- class: can be re-used for many sections (use . for css identification)
- html cannot put logic, but jinja file with extension of html can have logic
- jinja's logic and syntax is very similar to python
- use type and various attributes of the input of the form to set the restriction
- html is for static presentation of the information on the web, while javascript is for interaction between front-end web browser and the users. When applied to an HTML document, JS can provide dynamic interactivity on websites.
- both JS and CSS can be built into html file
- javascript library/framework: react
- bootstrap: overall for everything
- sketch: image editor
- ORM library: database
- sqlite: lighter version of SQL, inbuilt-library in python for database building --> in sqlite, the whole databse will be a single file, ie. many many tables in a single file (it's not like a flat file)
- <script> tag give the space for javascript codes
- document object represents the whole page for scripts
- can use javascript to change the content in html by using innerHTML() function
- we can parse variable from python to html(have dynamic contain in python and display them on html)
- put the link of the bootstrap within the header tag
- grab the variable from the html input in python by setting the variable name in python!
- OMFG validator does EVERYTHING for you man!!! Why does python have such AMAZING library!!!
- Do not hardcode html for every page man! Imagine how much you need to change when you want to change one feature of it!
  Code one page and just use variables which are different for all pages!
- SQLite, a database engine that a DBMS uses as underlying software to make CRUD operations from database/A database engine is the underlying system that a database uses to function.
- SQLite is like MySQL and SQL Server, which are all database engines, while SQL is a query language used in these databases.
- SQL can be used for database query in different programming languages with different syntaxes
- session in Flask is a dictionary.
- understand the magic behind Message Flashing!!
- use session to store information for each user
